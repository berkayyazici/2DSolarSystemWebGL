It is my homework of Computer Graphics. There are 2D models of Sun, Earth and Moon. As we all know, earth spins around the Sun and moon spins around the earth. 

You can click the buttons at the bottom of the canvas and make the Sun and Moon shines. Also, you can change the spinning size of earth and moon. When you change the 
speed as zero, model will be stopped. Then you can change the speed and model will be spinning from where it left.
